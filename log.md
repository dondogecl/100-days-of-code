# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 07, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I began reading the book "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras & Tensorflow" 2nd edition. Advanced 39 pages and began coding the first machine learning project.
I also coded some python, changing a Selenium webcrawling/scraping bot to migrate it from windows to a linux VM on GCP. It worked!
but not the first time... I spent 2 hours making changes and finally a function that detects new downloaded files and renames them works. Going to sleep at 2.44AM now...

**Thoughts:** I never tried to run the selenium bot on GCP, because I didn't know if it was possible to run google chrome or any browser on a CLI (without graphics). Now I know that I can using a virtual screen. I need to write a short tutorial about this!
Finally, NEVER allow a code to change all your filenames without checking first WHERE THE WORKING DIRECTORY/TARGET IS LOCATED! LOL
